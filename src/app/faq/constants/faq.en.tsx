  question: <>What is a non-fungible token (NFT)?</>,
  answer: (
    <>
      NFT stands for &lsquo;Non-fungible token&rsquo;, which means that it&apos;s a unique digital item with
      blockchain-managed ownership that users can buy, own, and trade. Some NFT&apos;s fundamental function is to be
      digital art.
      <br /> But they can also offer additional benefits like exclusive access to websites, event tickets, and ownership
      records. NFTs can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of
      digital files as unique items. NFTs use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of
      ownership. Stay safe, always do your own research.

      <>
        The Assets Club is a generative art collection with 31 base assets and 3000+ hand-drawn elements, enabled by a
        custom algorithm developed specifically for the generative processâ€”no AI, just pure creativity and
        craftsmanship.

    question: <>Is the collection already available on market place?</>,

      <>
        Indeed, the 10% of the collection is available on OpenSea. You can find it by visiting this{' '}
        <Link href="https://opensea.io/collection/theassetsclub">link</Link>.
        <br />
        This small portion was minted on April 27, 2023. For the upcoming mint on Abstract Chain, a wallet snapshot will
        allow ETH collection holders to mint the new collection for free. The number of mints available to each wallet
        will depend on the number of assets held. Afterward, the minting process will proceed with a private phase,
        followed by a public mint.{' '}

    question: <>What is generative art?</>,
    answer: (
      <>
        Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language
        rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some
        degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.
