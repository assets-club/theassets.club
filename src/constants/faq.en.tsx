  question: <>What is a non-fungible token (NFT)?</>,
  answer: (
    <>
      NFT stands for &lsquo;Non-fungible token&rsquo;, which means that it&apos;s a unique digital item with
      blockchain-managed ownership that users can buy, own, and trade. Some NFT&apos;s fundamental function is to be
      digital art.
      <br /> But they can also offer additional benefits like exclusive access to websites, event tickets, and ownership
      records. NFTs can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of
      digital files as unique items. NFTs use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of
      ownership. Stay safe, always do your own research.
